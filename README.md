## OVERVIEW
To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. 
There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

## INTRODUCTION
Here, we get data from the car website CarDekho.com, filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car.

## MOTIVATION

Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult. Several factors, including mileage, make, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately. Based on existing data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.
